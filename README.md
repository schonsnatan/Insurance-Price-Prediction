# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction ðŸš‘ðŸ’°

This project aims to predict medical insurance charges based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and region using machine learning regression models.

## ðŸ“Œ Features & Workflow
âœ… Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing data, and feature engineering.<br>
âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing relationships between variables using regression plots and boxplots.<br>
âœ… Model Training & Evaluation:<br>
- Linear Regression<br>
- Polynomial Regression (Pipeline for feature transformation)<br>
- Ridge Regression (To handle overfitting)<br>

âœ… Performance Metrics: RÂ² score, Mean Squared Error, and graphical comparison of real vs. predicted values.<br>
âœ… Deployment: Model saved using pickle for future predictions.<br>

## Results & Insights
- Polynomial Regression with scaling achieved the best RÂ² score.
- Smoking status and BMI significantly impact insurance charges.
